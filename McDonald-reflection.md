Merging and Push and Pull were clarified, although I could still use some more work.

We asked him questions about best practices and whether origina dn master were necessary,

I still feel I need practice with it to master it - which may just come with time sometimes I need clarification about which folders are being merged and how to merge them.

It was good, much better than I thought it might go.
