# Release 7: Reflect
Ransom Byers

## What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
* The difference and relationship between Fetch and Pull.
* When you are pushing and pulling, when do you need to specify origin and the branch name and when it is implied?

## What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
* How to fix a conflict on a local merge, not just one on GitHub.
* How useful git status is.

## What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
* My pair and I asked each other a lot of questions, most frequently about how to interpret the assignment and what it was asking us to do.
* I specifically remember asking our guide about Fetch and Pull, putting repos inside of other repos, and what is different between the message on a commit and the one on a pull request. There were some others.

## What still confuses you about Git?
* What scenarios would it really matter if you used Fetch vs Pull?
* If you try to merge a branch and there is a merge conflict, what state are you in? Are you still on the branch? Are you on smoe sort of temporary branch created to manage the conflict?
* If I push a branch to my personal repo on GitHub, then why can I create a pull request to other repos? Shouldn't I have to push to the repo that I want to merge into?

## How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
* It worked. That's good. I had been a little unsure about how well we would be able to work sharing screens in browser hangouts.
* Definitely we should do anything we can do to improve the reliablility of the connection. Losing bits of the audio really really slows things down. We may need to start using radio protocol if it is a recurring issue.
